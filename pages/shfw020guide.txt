====== SHFW v0.2.0 - short guide ======

Yes! It's finally there. We managed to provide our new firmware even to Xiaomi models without any restrictions.\\
We took control over all driving functionalities to provide you even more features. In addition we now have the\\
possibility to provide you any useful feature in the future.
